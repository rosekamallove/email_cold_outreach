Hey {{creator_name}} as predicted you ignored the last email and I get it email now a days is just spam but on an off chance you end up reading this one I would like to tell you, again, about the awesome tool we've been working on, it lets creators make interactive courses with generative AI.

We're still looking for 10 creators to join our beta program, and we'd love to have you on board.

I know you're probably busy, but I wanted to take a moment to remind you of the benefits of Kroto:

- You can create interactive content that responds to your input
- You can automate all aspects of course delivery, from payments to email marketing outreach
- You can focus on creating the best content for your course, and let us take care of the rest

We're confident that our platform can help you create the most interactive and engaging courses on the planet. We'd love to talk to you more about it.

If you're interested just reply to this email and we will take it from there.

Cheers,
Rose Kamal Love (CEO @Kroto)
