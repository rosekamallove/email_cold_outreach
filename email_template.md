Hey {{creator_name}},

**Minor Update:** Use this application form link: https://forms.gle/cMuNYyUhuhDpEwHVA

We're opening beta for a platform that lets creators make interactive courses with generative AI. You can create interactive content, automate payments and marketing, and focus on creating the best content.

**Here's how it works:**

- You write a text prompt that describes the course you want to create.
- Our generative AI algorithm will auto-generate the whole curriculum, as well as scripts for individual chapters.
- You can then customize the curriculum and scripts to your liking.
- Creating a chapter is a very simple process. You can add videos, photos, markdown, embeds for Figma, CodeSandbox, StackBlitz, and many more.

We're looking for **10 creators to join our beta program**.
If you're interested, apply here: [link to application form](https://7zw2277zqfl.typeform.com/to/FTF7ubdZ).

I'd love to chat with you more about it.
Hit me up if you have any questions.

Cheers,
Rose Kamal Love (CEO @Kroto)
